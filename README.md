 # Steps for execution
 
 Step 1:
 Install MongoDB using the following link:
 
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows
 
 Step 2: 
  Git Clone the Repository 
  
    git clone https://github.com/RAV-Organization/SE_Project3_calorieApp_server.git
    
  (OR) Download the .zip file on your local machine
  
    https://github.com/RAV-Organization/SE_Project3_calorieApp_server.git
  
 Step 3:
   Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal 
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install openai==0.28.0
    
 Step 4: 
    Go to https://platform.openai.com/ and create an API key for openai and paste it in application.py(in -> openai.api_key = '').

 Step 5:
    If it's for the first time you're running the application you need to run this script once to populate data for food select field

    `python insert_food_data.py`
    (Just once)

    Run the following command in the terminal
    
    `python application.py`
    
 Step 6:
    Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  
  OR if you prefer to run it on docker, follow till step 2 and then do

  Step 3: Run
  `docker compose up -d`
  (with and optional --build option at the end if you have already done the build and to build again)

  No need to manually populate the data as in the steps above. The docker config takes care of that :)

  Step 4: Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/ 


  ## Kubernetes

  - Navigate to the project directory.
  - Apply Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f app-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f app-service.yaml
    ```

    - Access Your Application

    Retrieve the external IP (LoadBalancer) or Cluster IP of the service:

    ```bash
    kubectl get service flask-mongo-service
    ```
