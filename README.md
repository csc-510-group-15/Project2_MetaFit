# METAFIT


![WhatsApp Image 2024-11-01 at 5 06 00 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2fe3d7e7-a387-4eaf-a16e-3fb3c8221738)

METAFIT is an easy-to-use application that tracks daily calories consumed and burned, helping users set goals like weight loss or gain. Users can edit their profile (height, weight, goal, target weight), enroll in fitness programs (yoga, workouts), and receive AI-powered meal suggestions tailored to their lifestyle and calorie intake. The app rewards daily login streaks, offers health quizzes to earn points, and allows users to share fitness milestones on social media.This document provides a major perspective for the users to understand and take up the project as an Open source software and add on multiple features before releasing to the market. Also, the document aids the developers in understanding the code and acts as a reference point for continuing the project.

 # Steps for execution
 
 Step 1:
 Install MongoDB using the following link:
 
 https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows
 
 Step 2: 
  Git Clone the Repository.
  
    git clone https://github.com/RAV-Organization/SE_Project3_calorieApp_server.git
    
  (OR) Download the .zip file on your local machine.
  
    https://github.com/RAV-Organization/SE_Project3_calorieApp_server.git
  
 Step 3:
   Install the required packages by running the following command in the terminal.
   
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install openai==0.28.0
    
 Step 4: 
    Go to https://platform.openai.com/ and create an API key for openai and paste it in application.py (in -> openai.api_key = '').

 Step 5:
    If it's for the first time you're running the application you need to run this script once to populate data for food select field.

    `python insert_food_data.py`
    (Just once)

    Run the following command in the terminal
    
    `python application.py`
    
 Step 6:
    Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/
  
  OR if you prefer to run it on docker, follow till step 2 and then do

  Step 3: Run
  `docker compose up -d`
  (with and optional --build option at the end if you have already done the build and to build again)

  No need to manually populate the data as in the steps above. The docker config takes care of that :)

  Step 4: Open the URL in your browser:  
      http://127.0.0.1:5000/ or http://localhost:5000/ 


  ## Kubernetes

  - Navigate to the project directory.
  - Apply Kubernetes deployment and service YAML files:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f app-deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f app-service.yaml
    ```

    - Access Your Application

    Retrieve the external IP (LoadBalancer) or Cluster IP of the service:

    ```bash
    kubectl get service flask-mongo-service
    ```
